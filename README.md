# Fix My App!

My application is broken... Please help me fix it! :weary: I am trying to build a small application using Express and Handlebars for people to learn about wild animals and contribute to the website by submitting information they have on different animals. But I'm a bit new to Express and server-side rendering in general so I'm not able to make my app work
properly... This is why I am hiring **YOU** to help put this product on the market :bowtie:

Here is everything you need to know to complete the task:

### Setup

Fork this repo on your own github profile and clone your fork on your local machine.
Build the database on your local machine using the build script. :construction:

### Routes

All the routes are discribed in `router.js`. All the routes you need are there, you just need to understand what they do and write the appropriate functions.

### Testing

Help future developpers work on this app by writing a series of tests that will help them debug the application if something breaks again in the future! Your tests should cover the server routes and the database queries. Every time that you find a function that doesn't behave as expected, you should write a test for the function and then make the test pass by fixing the code.

### Comments

Comment the code that you write so that other developpers can work on the project and understand easily what the code is doing!

### Database

The database schema is done, you only need to build the database on your computer. You can do this using the `db_build.js` script. Before creating the db schema I created a **models** folder were I was stored some __dummy data__ for starting my project. Some of the data is still being rendered by the app but this is not how it should be... All the data should be taken from the database.

### Styling

I'm not very much of a CSS person but I would love it if the app could look better then what it looks like right now... Let your creativity fly! :bird:
